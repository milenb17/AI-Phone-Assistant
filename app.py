# app_hardcoded.py
"""
Minimal FastAPI server that connects Twilio Voice calls to ConversationRelay
with *no* environment variables. Replace the PUBLIC_HOST below with your public URL.

Quickstart:
  1) pip install fastapi uvicorn
  2) Edit PUBLIC_HOST to your https host (e.g., your ngrok URL like https://abc123.ngrok.io)
  3) uvicorn app_hardcoded:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  4) In Twilio Console, set your phone number (or TwiML App) Voice URL to: https://<host>/voice

Flow:
  - /voice: returns TwiML with <Connect><ConversationRelay url="wss://<host>/ws" .../></Connect>
  - /ws: WebSocket endpoint that receives 'prompt' messages and replies with 'text' tokens.
